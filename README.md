# [WORKINPROGRESS]: Typescript ROP utilities

Inspired by https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/, I am creating a bunch of utility functions that work around the idea of Success and Fail results.

Goals:

* Works with Typescript
* Takes inspiration from ROP
* Takes inspiration from https://github.com/origamitower/folktale
